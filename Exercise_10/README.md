This exercise aims to slove advection equation using the upwind method and the FTCS(Forward Time Centered Space) method.

Please check the plot using the FTCS method([FTCS method](https://github.com/Heidi-cheng/Astro660_Computational_Astronomy/blob/main/Exercise_10/FTCS.png)).

The code is mostly provided by Prof. Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang, NTHU.
Some parts of the [evolution.f90](https://github.com/Heidi-cheng/Astro660_Computational_Astronomy/blob/main/Exercise_10/evolution.f90) and the [boundary.f90](https://github.com/Heidi-cheng/Astro660_Computational_Astronomy/blob/main/Exercise_10/boundary.f90) are editted by me.
